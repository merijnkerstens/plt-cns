# plt-cns

This is the repository associated with the paper "Deeply conserved non-coding sequences control PLETHORA1/2 expression and coordinate development" (Kerstens et al., 2025). The bash and R scripts (in Rmd format) are available as individual files.

## Instructions ##
The folder "Code" contains subfolders to extract PLT upstream sequences ("promoters") from the PLAZA5 Dicots database (van Bel et al., 2020), de novo motif analysis and extraction of the motifs corresponding to PLT1/2 BOX1 and BOX2. Please run the "prepare-promoters-xxx" script prior to the "extract-promoters-xxx" scripts, and the "meme_xxx.sh" scripts before the "fimo.sh" script.
